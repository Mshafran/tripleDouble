# tripleDouble

Description:
\nOur dynamic duo wishes to propose a collection of card games for the command prompt. We would start out from a title screen that allows the user to choose the game they wish to play. Initially, Blackjack will be the only available game but later versions may include other games as well. Currently, our program is capable of running Blackjack, War, and CrazyEights. The player would then play the chosen game against an AI that we program( or possibly even other player(s) at the same keyboard, though this has not been implemented as of yet). The rules of the game will be printed out before playing any game in case the player does not know the rules. We might also include some tips to help the player during the game (this could be a sort of tutorial mode).

How To Run:
\n1)Navigate to tripleDouble directory
\n2)javac Woo.java
\n3)java Woo
\n4)Enjoy!

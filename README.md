# tripleDouble

### Description:

Our dynamic duo wishes to propose a collection of card games for the command prompt. We would start out from a title screen that allows the user to choose the game they wish to play. Currently, the playable games are Blackjack, War, CrazyEights, Chase the Ace, and Go Fish. The player would then play the chosen game against an AI that we program. The rules of the game will be printed out before playing any game in case the player does not know the rules.


### How To Run:

1)Clone into the tripleDouble repo

2)Navigate to the tripleDouble directory in commandline

3)Once in the tripleDouble directory, type in "javac Woo.java"

4)Type in "java Woo"

5)Play card games to your heart's content. Remember: You don't need a poker face if you're playing in command line!
